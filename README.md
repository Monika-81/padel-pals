## **Design**

## **Data structure**
To get a clear view of what should be included and how the flow of the program should work, I used [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to construct a data model mock up as well as a mock up of the worksheet.

## **Technologies**

### **Languages**

- **Django**<br>

<br>

- **Other languages**<br>
The template provided by Code Institute for this project also includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Though I have not used this languages on my own development in this project, they provide a foundation for my project to be built and deployed correctly.
<br>

### **Tools**

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    -  I used Heroku to deploy the application.  

- [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
    - I used Lucid Chart to design the data model and list mock up for the project.

- [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    - I used GitPod as the code editor as well as to display to test out changes in my code.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - I used GitHub to create a repository for my project.

- [Google-auth](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
    - I used Google-auth to authenticate the Google API's so the project could be accessed in the cloud.

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
    - I used to create the API's that connects the application to the spreadsheet at Google Sheet.


- [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/)
    - I used PEP8 online check to test and validate my python code.

## **Testing**

For more information about the testing performed during the development, go to the separate [testing](/TESTING.md) page.

## **Deployment**

### **Deployment**

The project was deployed to **Heroku** from **GitPod**:
- After creating an account or logging in to an existing one on Heroku, click the "New" button on the right hand side of the 'Personal' menu.
- Choose the option 'Create new app' and then choose a unique name for your application and the right region. Then click 'Create New App'.
- Next you need to add buildpacks and create config vars, this is utterly **important** to have done before you deploy your app!

    .......
    - Then add config vars by clicking 'Reveal Config Vars'. I used _Config Var_ called `PORT`, set to `8000`.
    - If you have credentials for your project, you need to add these as well. Create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the copy of the requeriments code inside your credentials file into the value field.

- Now it's time to deploy the app. Go back to the top of the page and click "Deploy".
- Choose a deployment method, I used GitHub since my repository is located on GitHub.
- Scroll down to 'Connect to GitHub' and search for your project. Make sure you are connected to the right GitHub account. Click 'Connect'.
- Keep scrolling downwards, now you can choose between Automatic Deployment or Manual Deployment. I choose Manual first, until the app was properly deployed and a link to the app was visual. Then I choose to enable automatic deployment for smoother testing. 

The live app can be found here: https://padelpals.herokuapp.com/ (Yes! I made a type-o choosing the name of the application on Heroku and noticed too late to change it.)
<br>

<br>
<br>


A copy of this GitHub Repository can be made by either making a copy on your local machine or by forking the GitHub content. By using a copy of the repository changes can be made to the copy without affecting the original code. To make a copy of the repository, follow these steps:

### **Clone**
- Locate the repository at **GitHub**.
- At the top of the file's menu, click the green *code* button to the right.
- The first option in the drop-down menu is clone, where you get three choices of how to clone the repository.
- To clone a copy of the python project, click the 'copy' icon on the right-hand side of **Clone with HTTPS**.
- Choose your code editor, open GitBash and change the working directory to where you want the cloned directory to be made saved.
- In the terminal you write git clone and then paste the copied URL. Like this: '$ git clone https://github.com/Monika-81/padel-pals.git' 
- Press enter and then install the dependencies you like to use for the project. To run this project I recommend to atleast install **gspread**.
<br>

### **Forking**
- Locate the repository at **GitHub**.
- At the top right-hand side is a button called *fork*, click on the button to create a copy of the original repository in your GitHub Account.

## **Credits**

### **Content**

For most of the development and bug fixes I went back to the Code Institute LMS and the learning material for the ..... I also turned to the Slack community and the search function, where I found many tips when I got stuck. When I didn't find the answers to understand what I needed to change there, I consulted external sources while searching for the answer using Google. No piece of code was copied to use in the project, by reading on many different sites I learned more about python and used what I learned to try out was doing wrong.

Some of the sites I frequently **consulted** was :
<br>

* [CodeGrepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/)
* [DelftStack](https://www.delftstack.com/)
* [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/)
* [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
* [PythonGuides](https://pythonguides.com/)
* [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
* [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/)

<br>
The template used in the project was provided by Code Institute. The terminal design of the app on Heroku is due to the code supplied in the template.

### **Acknowledgement**

- My mentor **Precious Ijege** at Code Institute for valuable input and encouragement.
- The Slack community for be such an open, warm and sharing place. 
- **Alfred Skedebäck** for the original idea of an app he developed for private use. I've never seen or used the app he developed but it was the inspiration for this project.
- **Viet Hoang** for letting me run the app by him and for getting user experience input before, during and at the final stage of the project.
